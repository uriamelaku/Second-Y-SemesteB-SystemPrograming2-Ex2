# Implementation of operators on Graph Class 
## Introduction
This project consists of a C++ implementation of a graph class (Graph) with various functionalities for graph manipulation and operations. It includes overloaded operators to perform arithmetic operations, comparison, subset checking, and increment/decrement on graphs.

## Functions
1. loadGraph(vector<vector<int>> graph): Loads a graph represented by an adjacency matrix provided as a 2D vector of integers.

2. operator<<(ostream& os, const Graph& g): Overloaded stream insertion operator to print the adjacency matrix of the graph.

3. toString() const: Converts the adjacency matrix of the graph into a string format.

4. Arithmetic Operations:

- Addition (operator+): Adds two graphs element-wise.
- Addition Assignment (operator+=): Adds another graph to the current graph.
- Subtraction (operator-): Subtracts one graph from another element-wise.
- Subtraction Assignment (operator-=): Subtracts another graph from the current graph.
- Multiplication by Scalar (operator*, operator*=): Multiplies the graph by a scalar value.
- Division by Scalar (operator/, operator/=): Divides the graph by a scalar value.
- Matrix Multiplication (operator*): Multiplies two graphs as matrices.
5. Comparison Operations:

- Equality (operator==): Checks if two graphs are equal.
- Inequality (operator!=): Checks if two graphs are not equal.
- Subset (isSubsetOf, isProperSubsetOf): Checks if one graph is a subset or proper subset of another.
- Comparison (operator<, operator>, operator<=, operator>=): Compares the number of edges and matrix size of two graphs.
6. Increment and Decrement Operators:

- Pre-increment (operator++): Increments all elements of the graph.
- Post-increment (operator++(int)): Increments all elements of the graph (returns the original graph).
- Pre-decrement (operator--): Decrements all elements of the graph.
- Post-decrement (operator--(int)): Decrements all elements of the graph (returns the original graph).
7. printGraph(): Prints information about the graph, including the number of vertices and edges.

8. size() const: Returns the number of vertices in the graph.

9. getMatrix() const: Returns a constant reference to the adjacency matrix of the graph.

10. isDirected(): Checks if the graph is directed based on the presence of directed edges or differing edge weights.
